/**
 * There is a certain amount of initialization that needs to happen before
 * it makes sense to show anything to the user.
 *
 * Specifically:
 *
 * - We need to load persisted redux state, to know if the user is onboarding,
 *   what their projects are, etc.
 * - We want to parse the projects on disk to get up-to-date info, because
 *   the persisted redux state is incomplete; doesn't have info about tasks.
 *
 * This simple boolean reducer defaults to `false` and is toggled to `true`
 * once enough state has been loaded for us to show the user some UI.
