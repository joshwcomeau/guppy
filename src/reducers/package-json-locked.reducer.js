/**
 * Unlike a terminal, Guppy isn't locked up when performing actions like
 * installing or updating dependencies.
 *
 * This presents a problem, though; if the user quickly tries to update multiple
 * dependencies, there's a good chance that all but the first will fail. This
 * is because the first process writes to the package.json, and locks that file.
 * When the second dependency update tries to write to the file, it throws an
 * error.
 *
 * Eventually, it would be good to build a queue system, to abstract this away
 * from the user, so that they can just do whatever they want and we'll smartly
 * group actions when possible, and sequence them when not.
 *
 * For now, though, we'll just lock package-json-type actions while something
 * is in progress. And to track that, we have this simple reducer.
 *
 * Every project has its own package.json, and they shouldn't block each other.
 * So this is on a per-project basis.
